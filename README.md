# enaml-native
Build native mobile apps in python using enaml and native widgets!  

Android apps are currently working, iOS implementation is in the works (see #10).

   
### Features ###
1. Enaml's features: declarative syntax, conditional and looper rendering, automatic data binding
2. Web code editor via the [Python Playground](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frmdstryr.pythonplayground)!
3. Layouts with flexbox
4. Live app code reloading (like react-native's live reload)

### Docs and Examples ###

See the [project site](https://www.codelv.com/projects/enaml-native/)

### Apps ###

Apps using enaml-native can be found [here](https://www.codelv.com/projects/enaml-native/apps/).

### Demos ###
1. Try out the beta demo app here [on google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frmdstryr.enamlnative.demo)
2. Try out code without installing the android SDK or NDK via the [Python Playground](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frmdstryr.pythonplayground)!

The goal of this project is to be an alternative to using [kivy](https://kivy.org/) for building mobile apps with python. 

I made this because wanted to have a more "React Native" like environment that: 
1. Uses python 
2. Uses native widgets (Android / iOS)
3. Can be run from Android Studio / XCode (ie no bootstraps)
4. Uses enaml's models, and declarative and dynamic widget framework instead of kvlang
